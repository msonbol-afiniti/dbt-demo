      Call records data containing a detailed record that is generated for each call that arrives at a peripheral Contact Center environment. 
      The TCD record contains comprehensive information about the call, including customer and agent IDs, start time, end time, and agent site.
      Benchmark data is appended to the call record data by the client and shared in the same CSV file. 
      Data is shared daily as a csv file with 7 columns.

      Sales records as generated by the point-of-sale system for each sale interaction. The interaction may or may not end in an actual.
      A sale record should always have a unique identifier and should be attributed to an agent through the emp_id, and to a customer through cust_id.
      The sale flag indicates whether the sale interaction ended in a sale or not. This will be used as our binomial metric.
      Data is shared daily as a csv file with 5 columns.
